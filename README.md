# Hello World apps for cloud.gov

This repository contains minimal "Hello World" applications for a handful of different languages/frameworks for testing deployment to [cloud.gov](https://www.cloud.gov/), in particular, and other instances of [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org) ("CF") in general.
 
For [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov), follow the [quickstart guide](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/your-first-deploy/) for a guided tour, or follow the USAGE below.

## Usage

All of these examples, except Java, have the same usage. For Java, see its [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./java-see-instructions/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

1. Follow the [Cloud Foundry command-line (CLI) setup instructions](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).
1. Log into your Cloud Foundry account. (For example, if you use cloud.gov, follow [the "Set up the command line" instructions](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/setup/#set-up-the-command-line) to log in.)
1. Clone or download this repository, and `cd` into the directory `cf-hello-worlds`.
1. `cd` into the subdirectory for whatever language/framework you feel most comfortable with.
1. Deploy the application with `cf push`. Look for `urls` value when the push completes.
    ```bash{9}
    cf push --random-route

    ```
1. Visit your app with your browser at the URL assigned to your app. In the example above, that would be: e.g. https://php-random-words.app.cloud.gov

All of examples produce web applications that respond "Hello World from &lt;framework&gt;" on their index page.
