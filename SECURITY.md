**Reporting Security Issues**

Please refrain from reporting security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, kindly report them via the information provided in [cloud.gov's security.txt](https://cloud.gov/.well-known/security.txt).

When reporting, include the following details (as much as possible) to help us understand the nature and extent of the potential issue:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of related source file(s)
- Location of affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)
- Impact of the issue, including potential exploitation by attackers

Providing this information will facilitate a quicker triage of your report.
